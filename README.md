# fabricator

## Steps to setup on ubuntu 22.04

I recommend using tmux or byobu. Byobu is already installed in Ubuntu and you can activate it for all sessions by

```
byobu-enable
```

and when you'll log back, you'll be in it already.

You'd need to have docker installed:

```
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o install-docker.sh
sudo sh install-docker.sh
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```

If you're running in the lab login into the registry mirror with user `lab` and regular lab password:

```
docker login https://m.l.hhdev.io:31000
```

Install some deps

```
sudo apt update
// optional: sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install -y qemu-kvm swtpm-tools tpm2-tools socat
sudo usermod -aG kvm $USER
newgrp kvm
kvm-ok
```

Good output:

```
ubuntu@sl-hhfab-test-01:~$ kvm-ok
INFO: /dev/kvm exists
KVM acceleration can be used
```

Tips:

```
socat -,raw,echo=0,escape=0x1d unix-connect:.hhfab/vlab-vms/switch-1/serial.sock
```



// TODO(user): Add simple overview of use/purpose

## Description
// TODO(user): An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/fabricator:tag
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/fabricator:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
